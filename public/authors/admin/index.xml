      <description>I am a final year student with a passion for sociology, fine arts and quantitative empirical methods. I am currently working as an research assistant on the processing of Pierre Bourdieu&amp;rsquo;s photo archive, which was created during his field research in Algeria in the 1960s. Previously, I worked as a data analyst in private companies, but also as a trainee at EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Commission.
The unifying theme of my research is the translation of theories from the social sciences into an empirical design.</description>
