      <description>I am a final year undergraduate student with a keen interest in sociology, statistics and the analysis of social inequalities. I am currently working as an research assistant on the processing of Pierre Bourdieu&amp;rsquo;s photo archive, which was created during his field research in Algeria in the 1960s. Previously, I worked as a data analyst in private companies, but also as a trainee at EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Commission.</description>
