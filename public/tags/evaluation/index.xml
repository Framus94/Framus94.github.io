      <description>IntroAwards are conferred to candidates for the worth of their contribution, determined by relevant criteria in their respective field such as the arts or science. By emphasizing uncertainty, however, economic sociology draws attention to the ambiguity of the criteria that should enable a fair and effective selection process (Podolny 1994). Qualities of candidates could be very diverse and therefore not fully comparable. In other cases, candidates could satisfy the required criteria equally well, so that they are on a par with each other.</description>
