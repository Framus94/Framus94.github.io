Working at the intersection of the sociology of inequalities and valuation, I am interested in how status differences explain other forms of inequalities. 
In a current project, I use methods from computational social sciences to understand how processes of status formation affect the life courses of visual artists.

Before joining the London School of Economics to study Social Research Methods, I completed my undergraduate studies at Zeppelin University in Sociology, Politics & Economics. 
Also, I worked as a data analyst in private companies and as a trainee at EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Commission.

From time to time I work on smaller projects that spark my interest. Feel free to have a look at my [blog](#posts).
