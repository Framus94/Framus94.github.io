I joined Zeppelin University as research fellow in methodology where I am currently involved in teaching and the development of learning resources. Before this, I received my master's degree from the London School of Economics where I was awarded the Prize for the Best Overall Performance in the MSc Social Research Methods. I also worked as a data analyst in private companies and as a trainee at EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Commission.

My research is located at the intersection of the sociology of inequality and computational social sciences. I am interested in the processes by which we perceive people as unequally meritorious and things as more or less valuable. In particular, I look at the semantic and cultural construction of what societies define as worthy and how these definitions shape the life courses of individuals. Methodologically, I am fascinated by analytic strategies to capture the definition of worth, merit, prestige, and other factors that are drivers of social inequalities.

From time to time I work on smaller projects that spark my interest. Feel free to have a look at my [blog](#posts).
