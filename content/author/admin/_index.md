I am a final year student with a passion for sociology, fine arts and quantitative empirical methods. I am currently working as an research assistant on the processing of Pierre Bourdieu's photo archive, which was created during his field research in Algeria in the 1960s. Previously, I worked as a data analyst in private companies, but also as a trainee at EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Commission. 

The unifying theme of my research is the translation of theories from the social sciences into an empirical design. The tension that arises here poses exciting and challenging questions.
Have a look at my [blog](#posts) for some of my projects.
