  abstract = {In the nineteenth century, the Acad{\'e}mie des Beaux Arts, and institution of central importance to the artistic life of France for over two hundred years, yielded much of its power to the present system of art distribution, which is dependent upon critics, dealers, and small exhibitions. In Canvases and Careers, Harrison and Cynthia White examine in scrupulous and fascinating detail how and why this shift occurred. Assimilating a wide range of historical and sociological data, the authors argue convincingly that the Academy, by neglecting to address the social and economic conditions of its time, undermined its own ability to maintain authority and control.Originally published in 1965, this ground-breaking work is a classic piece of empirical research in the sociology of art. In this edition, Harrison C. White's new Foreword compares the marketing approaches of two contemporary painters, while Cynthia A. White's new Afterword reviews recent scholarship in the field.},

The authors find support for the classic account of high culture's purification and exclusiveness, showing how over the long Gilded Age the social elite of New York attended the Philharmonic both increasingly and in more socially patterned ways. Yet they also find that the orchestra opened up to a new group of subscribers hailing from an emerging professional, managerial, and intellectual middle class. Importantly, the inclusion of this new audience was segregated: they did not mingle with elites in the concert hall. This segregated inclusion paved a specific way for the constitution of cultural capital. It meant that greater purity and greater inclusiveness happened together, enabling elite cultural participation to remain distinctive while elite tastes acquired broader social currency.},

  volume = {37},
  issn = {0304-422X},
  abstract = {This article revisits David W. Galenson's work on the relationship between artistic creativity and the life cycle of artists. Galenson introduces a simple classification of creativity careers (early vs. late-bloomers), relates it to a bipartite typology of creativity (conceptual vs. experimental innovators) and builds on this typology to explain the decreasing trend of age at which artists were most creative over several generations in the 19th and 20th centuries. Drawing on Galenson's measures, the present paper uses a different approach to overcome possible criticisms to his design. Applying sequence analysis to creativity careers of 41 major modern painters, it also yields a fairly different story from the one Galenson proposes. In particular, I show that a typology of creativity should distinguish between creativity occurring within artistic movements and other forms of creativity. This distinction is important, for the decrease in age at peak creativity over time seems actually driven by the evolution of movement-related creativity alone. Investigating the specific issue of creativity over the life cycle of artists, and showing that movements and interactions play an important part in the picture, the paper thus suggests there is something more than the mere individual involved in artistic creativity.},

By expanding on the dichotomous concepts of the division of production presented by Marcia Bystryn in terms of experimental and gatekeeping galleries and those of Raymonde Moulin which distinguished between the work of 'entrepreneurs' and 'negotiators', I focus on the complexities of the gallery system which operates, in my view, much more centrally in the middle-range of uncertainty. This paper does two things: (1) it provides a typology of the distribution of uncertainty in galleries based on the kinds of artistic and personal resources available to the dealer; and, (2) it identifies strategies used by galleries to manage different levels of uncertainty. These strategies include turning liabilities into assets; creating risks; and economic and aesthetic diversification.},

We have mapped relationships between the actors and thus the field structures that these relationships entail. The fields in which a segment of an art world is operating is represented in multi-dimensional figures which illustrate relationships and bonds between the different categories of organizations. Some of the business actors we have studied are engaging in cultural activities with a great deal of autonomy, others are connected to the cultural field in less active ways. In participating in the cultural field they are in different ways and to different extents accumulating symbolic capital including prestige and honor. The method we have applied is multiple correspondence analysis which was frequently used by Bourdieu.},

  shorttitle = {The Social Construction of Quality},
  abstract = {The association between quality assessment and status attainment is fundamental in the sociology of markets. However, past literature failed to explain status dynamics such as mobility in the status order where highly uncertain goods make quality hard to measure. This paper contributes to the understanding of this relationship by identifying various social mechanisms behind quality evaluation processes. It also explores why certain products are considered to be more valuable than others. The results demonstrate that only through exchange relations and active participation in the marketplace (what I call status actions) can actors affect the social definition of what are perceived as high-quality products.

The findings improve the understanding of the evolution and dynamics of status in uncertain markets from both micro- and macro-sociology of markets.

  abstract = {Der Artikel zeigt zun{\"a}chst Zusammenh{\"a}nge zwischen Korrespondenz- und Netzwerkanalyse auf, vor allem in Bezug auf ihre gemeinsame Ausgangsbasis, die aus Affiliationen von Akteuren zu Organisationen besteht. Besonders interessant ist in diesem eher technischen Vergleich die Verbindung aus Theorie und Mathematik: Die Korrespondenzanalyse hebt exklusive Merkmale hervor, was zu Bourdieus Konzept des Distinktionsgewinns passt (312). 

Der Autor weist anschlie{\ss}end darauf hin, dass Bourdieu die Anwendung netzwerkanalytischer Verfahren aus zwei Gr{\"u}nden ablehnte: "mistaking consequences for causes and disregarding time and history" (317). 
1) Bourdieu unterscheidet Struktur bzw. objektive Relationen von Interaktion bzw. intersubjektive Relationen. Erstere sind latent vorhanden und k{\"o}nnen durch Korrespondenzanalyse extrahiert werden. Letztere sind manifest und sind der Gegenstand von Studien, die aus der Perspektive des symbolischen Interaktionismus und der Netzwerkanalyse durchgef{\"u}hrt werden. Interaktionen sind jedoch eher das Resultat objektiver Relationen, als dass sie die Gr{\"u}nde f{\"u}r Sozialstruktur darstellen.
2) "Bourdieu's second objection to symbolic interactionism concerns its exclusive focus on the present, which entails a denial of the past. Symbolic interactionists grant the person a lot of freedom in assigning symbolic value to the actions and interactions that s/he perceives. According to Bourdieu, however, this freedom is very limited because the symbolic value of behavior is strongly guided by categories of perception that originated in the past and that have been transmitted from generation to generation through processes of socialization."

Der Autor sieht Netzwerkanalyse jedoch als Erweiterung der Feld- und Praxistheorie: "In my opinion, objective relations are not autonomous forces that directly and continuously affect each field. They become operative when people or organizations take part in the interaction within a field, bringing to bear properties and qualifications characteristic of another field. This triggers a group process, creating winners and losers among the members of the field (micro effect) and repositioning the field with respect to the `challenging' field (macro effect). In the process new symbolic distinctions and values are being created or existing ones are being reaffirmed or discarded.
Therefore, it is important to analyze how, when, and to what extent objective relations affect the interaction and structure of a field as well as the symbolic value of categories and qualifications in a particular period. Correspondence analysis cannot perform this task because it abstracts from the actual interaction among. Network analysis is indispensable here."

Im weiteren Verlauf werden noch Hinweise auf Studien gegeben, wie Interaktion die Verteilung von Kapitalsorten beeinflusst, so dass der Autor folgern kann, dass Interaktion den Effekt objektiver Strukturen mediieren und ver{\"a}ndern kann: "Objective relations do not operate on the basis of mere homology between fields."

Art in general, and the literary field in particular, is interpreted as a differentiated social field that is autonomous in the sense that it follows its own logic - the competition for cultural legitimation. What literature has in common with other social systems is the stratification of its internal structure into a hierarchical arrangement. Thus the literary field can be described as a horizontally differentiated system that is, however, vertically differentiated internally.The concern of the paper is to test Bourdieu's theoretical considerations empirically. Data for the analysis and interpretation are based on interviews of Cologne writers. The data are analysed with the aid of blockmodel and correspondence analysis. As far as the data allows us to operationalise the thesis that the literary field is an autonomous differentiated system, Bourdieu's thesis is confirmed. The internal structure can be described more precisely: the first line of demarcation is, in fact, the difference that Bourdieu described between legitimate and illegitimate art: high-culture literature and low-culture literature are the two poles of the literary field. The realm of the legitimate literature is further differentiated into three blocks (elite, junior elite, periphery). The elite and the periphery differ in terms of the different degrees of success. The junior elite occupies an intermediate place. Bourdieu's sociology of literature is supported by the empirical material at hand.},

The theatrical field is formalized as an affiliation network of companies participating in stage co-productions in Italy's Campania region, over four theatre seasons. Differently from Bourdieu, but similarly to other works in the sociology of culture and the arts, the study focuses on relational and attribute-based dimensions of theatre production, presenting a novel way to combine field theory and SNA. By adopting the positional approach of SNA through Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and blockmodeling for affiliation networks, the study reveals oppositions among companies by reason of their differential partnerships in co-productions, and a combination of hierarchy and segmentation characterizing the network structure of the field. These oppositions also appear in the `objective' social space defined by the attributes of companies and coproductions (positions and position-takings), showing the unequal distribution of symbolic cultural capital among theatre producers and the latter's inclinations towards different theatrical styles and genres.},

Attention was paid to the networks surrounding literary magazines and publishing houses, as well as to networks resulting from evaluations, comparisons and literary orientations expressed in reviews and interviews.

To do so, I offer a nested, multilevel approach that attends to producers, authors and product types. The results show that, in all three countries, authors who have properties that signal the market logic become more dominant, while retrospectively consecrated authors less often make the lists. This trend is stronger for the US than for Germany and France. The differences between the latter two countries decline over time.},

Because of its relatively weak professional development, the consecrating authorities play a major role in the regulating of the literary field and in the building of careers. This article examines literary institutions which appear in different periods: the Acad{\'e}mie fran{\c c}aise, which obtained its power from the state under the Old Regime; the societies of authors and the publishers, which contributed to the professional development of literary activity with the growth of the book market and the withdrawal of the state from the control of this market; the literary journals as relatively autonomous authorities; the literary prizes that are torn between autonomy and heteronomy (with the Goncourt prize as an example); the role of translation and international circulation in the process of consecration; and finally, the festival as a new form of literary recognition, which reflects the process of democratization (based on an empirical study on Les Correspondances de Manosque).},

A multilevel design is needed to account for dependencies among ties and vertices, which should not be ignored in a small longitudinal network. Time-varying covariates are required to analyze network effects, that is, the impact of previous ties. In addition, a discrete-time event history model handles constraints on who can act or who can be acted upon in a straightforward way. The model can be estimated with multilevel logistic regression analysis, which is illustrated by an application to book reviews, so network evolution can be analyzed with a fairly standard statistical tool.},

Drawing from extensive ethnographic, survey, and interview data gathered in Paris, New York, and Toronto, we explore the social dynamics of readings in order to understand better how these public and social gatherings contribute to poetry economies and careers. While differences exist between the locations for our research, the similarities are striking: we find that readings are crucial to poetry economies because they foster and maintain distribution networks for contemporary poetry in a global marketplace that tends to `squeeze out' forms of art that lack broad commercial appeal. We also find, across these locations, that readings are used in different ways by poets at different stages of career (i.e., unestablished, established, and wellestablished) and by poets operating in different genres (i.e., those writing `for the stage' versus those writing `for the page'). Finally, we emphasize that readings provide an important space in which poets and others (e.g., booksellers, publishers) navigate the difficulties of making art while dealing with the necessities of money. \# 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the prestige of artists and institutions are intertwined. Artists derive their prestige at least in part from their affiliations to art organizations, and the prestige of organizations is based on the artists which they are able to take on. This paper introduces a simple but efficient index to measure dynamic prestige from a longitudinal network of affiliations. It is shown that the prestige of literary magazines can be computed from the flow of authors between magazines and that it correlates strongly with external indicators of literary prestige. An advanced method for analyzing longitudinal networks was used to demonstrate that this index of prestige predicts the exchange of authors between magazines whereas static indices of prestige do not.

Value attribution was measured by establishing the attention authors receive from such institutions as literary encyclopedias, literary prizes, academic studies, and publishing houses. Measurements were conducted for 502 authors varying in both critical acclaim and public appeal. The statistical technique Princals was used to analyze institutions' measures. The results show that one dimension stood out, which was interpreted as authors' literary prestige. Given its institutional base, this form of prestige is called Institutional Literary Prestige (ILP). The subsequent classification of authors met expectations.

Formal network analysis mainly aims at a description of network structures as well as at an explanation of the behavior of the network at the systemic level. Formal network analysis can also be used in order to explain individual behavior or the existence of individual connections from network structure. Statistical analyses of ego-centered networks are used to correlate individual attributes with the structure and composition of the individual embeddedness, thus providing a statistical explanation of network effects and determinants. Qualitative methods are important for exploring network structures, and for understanding the meaning connected to them. A historical overview shows that these three strands have long co-existed in sociological network research without engaging in combined research efforts. Combinations of these methods prove useful when considering the various aspects of networks (individual connections, structural patterns, and meaning).},

We first draw the space of positions in poetry, before offering powerful methodological methods to analyze artistic careers\textemdash{}that is, sequence analysis that we combine with logit models. We show that, in contrast to the intuition of Bourdieu (1996) in The Rules of Art, poetry is not characterized by anarchy but, instead, is a very structured social space wherein recognition is consensual, as well as hierarchized. We then show that careers at the pure pole are long, progressively cumulative and irregular. These results refine previous studies where slow accumulation of reputation corresponded to linear, if not regular, careers (e.g., Giuffre, 1999). We also discusses cumulative advantage theory (e.g., Menger, 2009), as well as status-based models of hierarchies (e.g., Podolny, 2005), so as to offer a usable model of objectivizing artists' positions in their field. We thus build on Bourdieu and his followers, who have offered insights but little systemic investigation of the organization of the pure pole, whereas it plays a key conceptual role in the sociology of literature and, indeed, in the Bourdieusian framework.},

  abstract = {A dynamic of imitation among client firms produces the high level of isomorphism observable in their auditor selection. However, theform and extent of a corporate actor's behavior are influenced by the actor's position among competing peers. Examining 2,285 auditor-client pairs, this studyfinds that the likelihood of imitation in auditor selection systematically varies across the status dimension. First, the leaders in an industry seek to differentiate themselves from their chief competitors. Second, the firms of the middle stratum imitate the leaders in their industry extensively by choosingfrom the same set of auditors. Third, the firms at the bottom seem to be excluded from this concern. This interplay between inclusion and exclusion among socially differentiated actors, in turn, yields substantial polarization in size among CPA firms and hence the extreme market share concentration that characterizes the audit services market.},

In a nationwide study (N=2516) by Burda (1988) and SINUS 27 pictures of flat interior decorations were shown. The degree of consent is the data base of this study. By using both mentioned techniques one wanted to check if there are any combinations which can be interpreted as 'style', and which characteristics of the respondents correspond with which style.

I develop a conceptual view of the social institutions that comprise markets, discuss a sociological model of action in which market participants try to create stable worlds and find social solutions to competition, and discuss how markets and states are intimately linked. From these foundations, I generate propositions about how politics in markets work during various stages of market development--formation, stability, and transformation. At the formation of markets, when actors in firms are trying to create a status hierarchy that enforces noncompetitive forms of competition, political action resembles social movements. In stable markets, incumbent firms defend their positions against challengers and invaders. During periods of market transformation, invaders can reintroduce more fluid social-movement-like conditions.},

While most sociologists know about Bourdieu's study Distinction (1986) and its analysis of consumption, there is less awareness of the fact that Bourdieu himself, towards the end of his life, said that he had produced three major studies of economic topics. These are: his work in Algeria on `the economy of honour and ``good faith''' (1950s and 1960s); his study of credit (Bourdieu et al., 1963); and his study of the economy of single-family houses (Bourdieu et al., 1999). These three studies are presented and discussed in detail, and so is Bourdieu's attempt to formulate a general program for `economic anthropology' in his article `The Economic Field' (1997), drawing on such concepts as field, habitus and capital. Some critique has been directed at Bourdieu's analysis of the economy, and this is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

The consumer marketis identified as a status market, while the production market is defined as a 'standard'market. In a status market, order is maintained because the identities of actors onboth sides of the market are ranked according to status, which is a more entrenchedsocial construction than the commodity traded in the market. In a market characterizedby standard the situation is reversed: the commodity is a more entrenched socialconstruction than the identity rankings of actors in the market. The study ties togetherproduction and consumption through an analysis of commodities in the market.The results are based on extensive fieldwork and interviews, as well as textual materialfrom four countries: India, Sweden, Turkey and the UK. -- -- Ziel dieses Discussion Papers ist die Analyse der sozialen Konstruktion von Ordnung in zwei angrenzenden M{\"a}rkten innerhalb der Produktionskette der globalen Bekleidungsindustrie. Der Endverbrauchermarkt wird als "Statusmarkt", der Produktionsmarkt als "Standardmarkt" definiert. In einem Statusmarkt wird die Ordnung dadurch aufrecht erhalten, dass die Akteuridentit{\"a}ten auf beiden Seiten des Marktes eine Rangfolge gem{\"a}{\ss} dem Status der Akteure haben. Diese Statushierarchie ist eine fester gef{\"u}gte soziale Konstruktion als die gehandelte Ware an sich. In einem durch Standard charakterisierten Markt ergibt sich eine umgekehrte Situation: die Handelsware stellt eine gefestigtere soziale Konstruktion als die Statushierarchie der Akteuridentit{\"a}ten im Markt dar.

  abstract = {Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children's and adolescents' lives, with 97\% playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of ``gaming'' has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.},

  volume = {5},
  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance data acquired in a task-absent condition (``resting state'') require new data analysis techniques that do not depend on an activation model. In this work, we introduce an alternative assumption- and parameter-free method based on a particular form of node centrality called eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality attributes a value to each voxel in the brain such that a voxel receives a large value if it is strongly correlated with many other nodes that are themselves central within the network. Google's PageRank algorithm is a variant of eigenvector centrality. Thus far, other centrality measures - in particular ``betweenness centrality'' - have been applied to fMRI data using a pre-selected set of nodes consisting of several hundred elements. Eigenvector centrality is computationally much more efficient than betweenness centrality and does not require thresholding of similarity values so that it can be applied to thousands of voxels in a region of interest covering the entire cerebrum which would have been infeasible using betweenness centrality. Eigenvector centrality can be used on a variety of different similarity metrics. Here, we present applications based on linear correlations and on spectral coherences between fMRI times series. This latter approach allows us to draw conclusions of connectivity patterns in different spectral bands. We apply this method to fMRI data in task-absent conditions where subjects were in states of hunger or satiety. We show that eigenvector centrality is modulated by the state that the subjects were in. Our analyses demonstrate that eigenvector centrality is a computationally efficient tool for capturing intrinsic neural architecture on a voxel-wise level.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the structural determinants of power in exchange networks, along with research findings from laboratory experiments and a computer simulation of bargaining in network structures. Two theoretical traditions are dealth with: (1) point centrality in graph-theoretic representations of structure, as an approach to power distributions; and (2) power dependence principles applied to exchange networks. Measures of centrality available in the literature have the advantage of being easily applied to large and complex networks. In contrast, power dependence concepts were conceived for use in microsociology and are found to be cumbersome in the analysis of complex networks. But despite the relative difficulty of applying power-dependence theory to network structures, that approach generates hypotheses about power distributions which are confirmed at nearly every point in a laboratory experiment with five-person networks and at every point in a computer simulation of networks too large for laboratory study. In contrast, centrality measures applied to the type of networks studied fail to predict power distributions. Although centrality measures might predict power in some networks, their generality is limited. Toward resolution of the issues raised, this study offers two theoretical points: (1) a distinction between two different principles of "connection" in social networks suggests that current measures of centrality might predict power in one type of network but not in the other; and (2) it offers a first step toward a fusion of power-dependence theory and structural centrality in a way which might be general across networks of both types.},

  abstract = {The field of art in the Hanseatic City of Hamburg, Germany, is a dynamic and so far scarcely researched phenomenon. This study seeks to analyze the field's change in the perception of relevant actors in this field. Therefore, the study applies a Grounded Theory approach, elaborating the qualitative character of this descriptive-explorative analysis. The study's empirical foundation is a set of semi-structured interviews with actors in the field of art in Hamburg, backed by secondary data obtained from the Artfacts- and Artprice data base. The study draws a detailed and distinctive picture of the field and depicts its change over time. As a main result, it is found that the field of art galleries in Hamburg, which is a subfield of the art field, is characterized by geographic clusters. While there is a remarkable center-periphery divide as well as a substantial north-south divide, there are also indications of a west-east divide.

  abstract = {In this article I develop a proposal for the theoretical vantage point of the sociology of markets, focusing on the problem of the social order of markets. The initial premise is that markets are highly demanding arenas of social interaction, which can only operate if three inevitable coordination problems are resolved. I define these coordination problems as the value problem, the problem of competition and the cooperation problem. I argue that these problems can only be resolved based on stable reciprocal expectations on the part of market actors, which have their basis in the socio-structural, institutional and cultural embedding of markets. The sociology of markets aims to investigate how market action is structured by these macrostructures and to examine their dynamic processes of change. While the focus of economic sociology has been primarily on the stability of markets and the reproduction of firms, the conceptualization developed here brings change and profit motives more forcefully into the analysis. It also differs from the focus of the new economic sociology on the supply side of markets, by emphasizing the role of demand for the order of markets, especially in the discussion of the problems of valuation and cooperation.},

Our main findings are that the size and material of works of art, and the age and place of residence of the artist are strong predictors of price; that differences in size and materials partly ``mask'' price differences between artists; and that the variance in prices across galleries is largely explained by characteristics of the artists they represent.},

- How artistic excellence can encourage wider and deeper engagement with

- How to establish a light touch and non-bureaucratic method to judge the
quality of the arts in the future.
`The arts' encompasses a variety of forms. I have focused on those supported by
public funding. These include the work of museums and galleries supported
through the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Museums,
Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) and the performing and visual arts and
literature supported by Arts Council England.
This report is founded on the belief that excellent culture goes to the root of living
and is therefore relevant to every single one of us. There are many examples of
excellent work to be found in this country today, but this report suggests that with
some tuning of approach, our society could foster even more exciting and vibrant

This process is seen as part of the overall struggle of `making names' - enacted by critics, curators, and dealers - that structures recognition, results in artistic change, and reproduces central distinctions in the fine art world. Informed by Bourdieu's formulation of cultural fields, the study is grounded in numerous sources, including fieldwork observations, secondary data analyses, a review of more than three hundred exhibitions, and interviews with key art world agents. To begin, the social organization of the mid-1980s New York art market is outlined as a spatial economy of name recognition, broadly composed of three agonistic segments. Afterward, the incorporation of a new African art into organizational and discursive structures is examined as the outcome of ongoing struggles between competing `position-takings'. Symbolic and material exigencies within the art market motivating the selection of such works, as well as specific strategies used in framing them as creations of disinterested individuals, are also examined. 0 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

First, the greater the market uncertainty, the more that organizations engage in exchange relations with those with whom they have transacted in the past. Second, the greater the uncertainty, the more that organizations engage in transactions with those of similar status.

Using strategic alliance networks in the semiconductor and steel industries, we build on past embeddedness research by examining the interaction of these factors. We argue that the roles relational and structural embeddedness play in firm performance can only be understood with reference to the other. Moreover, we argue that the influence of these factors on firm performance is contingent on industry context. More specifically, our empirical analysis suggests that strong ties in a highly interconnected strategic alliance network negatively impact firm performance. This network configuration is especially suboptimal for firms in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, strong and weak ties are positively related to firm performance in the steel and semiconductor industries, respectively.},

When supply and demand are mainly defined by quality and an asymmetrical relation makes the client, unlike the salesman, unable to differentiate between good and bad quality, his purchase is based on judgment rather than on the price; he is more closely related to a social organisation with its network of trust, than to the neoclassical market. This interpretation, founded on both the economy of the legal profession and on an important growing part of global economy, allows one to state that alongside authority and prices, judgment represents an organisational factor of economic life.

Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West? Is America moving from a virtuous circle, in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted, to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority? What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity?

This account acknowledges that novel ideas must be elaborated on and conceptually translated before they can be adopted and applied to field-specific problems. We motivate our account by examining an exemplary case of knowledge diffusion, namely, the early spread of theories of rational decision-making. These theories were grounded in a set of novel mathematical tools and concepts that originated in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944/1947) and subsequently spread widely across the social and behavioral sciences. Introducing a network-based diffusion measure, we trace the spread of those tools and concepts into distinct research areas. We furthermore present an analytically tractable typology for classifying publications according to their roles in the diffusion process. The proposed framework allows for a systematic examination of the conditions under which scientific innovations spread within and across preexisting and newly emerging scientific communities.},

Data were collected at two time points in three German higher secondary schools (grades 7\textendash{}10, average age at measurement: 14.26 years). Using a cross-lagged panel design (CLPD), study 1 (N = 251) found adolescents with low moral competence to be susceptible to peer influence, while no such effect was found for adolescents with high moral competence. Study 2, a cross-sectional analysis (N = 748), found moral competence to be inversely related to the likelihood of an individual's conforming with the pro-bullying behavior of his or her peers. Neither study found corresponding effects for pro-social, defending behavior. Our findings further illuminate the associations between moral competence, peer influence, and school bullying. Some implications for bullying prevention are discussed.},

Given this distinction, the article considers how the value of ``structural holes'' and market status vary with these two types of uncertainty. The article proposes that the value of structural holes increases with egocentric uncertainty, but not with altercentric uncertainty. In contrast, the value of status increases with altercentric uncertainty, but declines with egocentric uncertainty. Thus actors with networks rich in structural holes should sort into markets or market segments that are high in egocentric uncertainty; high-status actors should sort into markets that are low in egocentric uncertainty. Support for this claim is found in an examination of the venture capital markets.},

This study aims to explain the variation of the state of democratisation in the different countries, as well as identify the factor(s) behind this variation. Six countries are selected for the analysis; half of them experienced major changes, the other half just minor political changes. These are tested against the modernisation theory, while controlling for Huntington's theory about waves of democratisation. The chosen method is a comparative politics method, together with quantitative analysis. The result shows that, contrary to the modernisation theory and the hypothesis, economic and socioeconomic development does not explain the variation in the state of democratisation. Countries with minor political changes are, to some extent, also more developed. The result further suggests that other factors such as economic failure and monarchy's resilience could possibly explain the variation in the state of democratisation.},

Different social groups prefer different political institutions because of the way they allocate political power and resources. Thus democracy is preferred by the majority of citizens, but opposed by elites. Dictatorship nevertheless is not stable when citizens can threaten social disorder and revolution. In response, when the costs of repression are sufficiently high and promises of concessions are not credible, elites may be forced to create democracy. By democratizing, elites credibly transfer political power to the citizens, ensuring social stability. Democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentive to overthrow it. These processes depend on (1) the strength of civil society, (2) the structure of political institutions, (3) the nature of political and economic crises, (4) the level of economic inequality, (5) the structure of the economy, and (6) the form and extent of globalization.},

Other relevant factors include the placement of the paintings (on altars, ceilings or walls), whose impact reflects differences in demand elasticities. We find evidence of the law of one price confirming price equalization between high and low demand geographical destinations and between different subjects. Finally, in a Schumpeterian perspective, we relate the temporal trend of the price of a representative painting with waves of artistic innovations, whose peacks were in the 1500s and in the 1700s with a dark Baroque age in the intermediate century.},

They are one of the most fundamental types of stochastic processes; can be used to model numerous phenomena, including diffusion, interactions, and opinions among humans and animals; and can be used to extract information about important entities or dense groups of entities in a network. Random walks have been studied for many decades on both regular lattices and (especially in the last couple of decades) on networks with a variety of structures. In the present article, we survey the theory and applications of random walks on networks, restricting ourselves to simple cases of single and non-adaptive random walkers. We distinguish three main types of random walks: discrete-time random walks, node-centric continuous-time random walks, and edge-centric continuous-time random walks. We first briefly survey random walks on a line, and then we consider random walks on various types of networks. We extensively discuss applications of random walks, including ranking of nodes (e.g., PageRank), community detection, respondent-driven sampling, and opinion models such as voter models.},

Such a ``socio-economic laboratory'' allows to unveil the intricate interplay of spatial constraints, social and economic factors, and patterns of mobility. We find that the motion of individuals is not only constrained by physical distances, but also strongly shaped by the presence of socio-economic areas. These regions can be recovered perfectly by community detection methods solely based on the measured human dynamics. Moreover, we uncover that long-term memory in the time-order of visited locations is the essential ingredient for modeling the trajectories.},

Using data from actual auditions, in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases the probability a woman will be advanced and hired. Although some of our estimates have large standard errors and there is one persistent effect in the opposite direction, the weight of the evidence suggests that the blind audition procedure fostered impartiality in hiring and increased the proportion women in symphony orchestras.},

  abstract = {A large number of complex systems find a natural abstraction in the form of weighted networks whose nodes represent the elements of the system and the weighted edges identify the presence of an interaction and its relative strength. In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large-scale networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction pattern, with degree and weight distributions that vary over many orders of magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links, make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network's backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining approaches and filtering techniques come into conflict with the multiscale nature of large-scale systems. Here, we define a filtering method that offers a practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the weight distribution. We apply our method to real-world network instances and compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.},

  abstract = {In areas of human activity where performance is difficult to quantify in an objective fashion, reputation and networks of influence play a key role in determining access to resources and rewards. To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition network that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this network captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.},

Wealth\textendash{}income ratios, inherited wealth, and wealth inequalities were high in the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries up until World War I, then sharply dropped during the twentieth century following World War shocks, and have been rising again in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We discuss the models that can account for these facts. We show that over a wide range of models, the long-run magnitude and concentration of wealth and inheritance are an increasing function of r {\`A} g where r is the net-of-tax rate of return on wealth and g is the economy's growth rate. This suggests that current trends toward rising wealth\textendash{}income ratios and wealth inequality might continue during the twenty-first century, both because of the slowdown of population and productivity growth, and because of rising international competition to attract capital.},

We propose that individuals in fields as diverse as philosophy, literature, mathematics, painting, or architecture gain visibility by cumulating the eminence of others connected to them across and within generations. We draw on interaction ritual chain and social movement theories, and use evidence from the field of modernist architecture, to formulate a model of how networks of very strong ties generate motivations and emotional enthusiasm, change reputations, and form collective movements that over time transform the structure of cultural fields. Because major aesthetic innovations break sharply with older styles, they need very strong group solidarity over a long period of time to propagate a new standard of practice. We propose mutual halo effects, i.e., the reciprocal reinforcement of upstream and downstream prestige on a given individual node, as the key factor accounting for success in a cultural production field. We discuss the relevance of these results for building a model of influence and innovation in cultural production fields in which networks\textemdash{}reshaped by shifting technological, political, and economic conditions\textemdash{}trigger new styles.},

We find it reasonable to expect than an artistic education can have a significant impact on artists' careers because of the importance of technical skills, networks and signaling effects. We analyze the question by using a unique longitudinal dataset for five different groups of artists in Denmark, using the Cox model to apply survival functions and semi-parametric analysis. The results show, among other things, that an artistic education has a significant impact on artists' careers in the arts, and we find important industry differences.},

  abstract = {Artistic labor markets are puzzling ones. Employment as well as unemployment are increasing simultaneously. Uncertainty acts not only as a substantive condition of innovation and self-achievement, but also as a lure. Learning by doing plays such a decisive role that in many artworlds initial training is an imperfect filtering device. The attractiveness of artistic occupations is high but has to be balanced against the risk of failure and of an unsuccessful professionalization that turns ideally non-routine jobs into ordinary or ephemeral undertakings. Earnings distributions are extremely skewed. Risk has to be managed, mainly through flexibility and cost reducing means at the organizational level and through multiple job holding at the individual level. Job rationing and an excess supply of artists seem to be structural traits associated with the emergence and the expansion of a free market organization of the arts. Reviewing research done not only by sociologists, but also by economists, historians and geographers, our chapter focuses on four main issues: the status of employment and career patterns, the rationales of occupational choice, occupational risk diversification, and the oversupply of artists.},

I argue that there is an analogy between social movement success and recognition as art, so that the major concepts that explain the paths of social movements also apply to art worlds: political opportunity structures, resource mobilization, and framing processes. In addition, I incorporate the social psychological perspective on legitimacy to specify the process by which art worlds achieve artistic legitimation.},

Among them, in France, agents, tourneurs and managers are intermediaries of the music labour market who aim to develop artists' career. What role do these underestimated yet more and more numerous intermediaries play in achieving pop artists' recognition? Statistical data show a strong relation between the amount of symbolic capital of artists and having at least one of these intermediaries work for them. In order to analyse how they can help further the artist's access to recognition, I develop a specific use of the concept of symbolic capital that allows a better understanding of social mechanisms of value production. The analysis of qualitative data discloses the various resources and strategies intermediaries use in the artists' acquisition of symbolic capital. They do promotional work, but also take calculated risks to how to place their artists in the market, and constantly work on their social network to create opportunities.},

On the basis of in-depth interviews with art dealers in New York and Amsterdam, I address two pricing norms: one norm inhibits art dealers from decreasing prices; the other induces them to set prices according to size. To account for these pricing norms, I argue that price setting is not just an economic but also a signifying act: despite their impersonal, businesslike connotations, actors on markets manage to express a range of cognitive and cultural meanings through prices. Previously, meanings of prices have been recognized in signaling theories within economics. However, these meanings are restricted to profit opportunities. Within the humanities, by contrast, meanings of prices are restricted to contaminating or corrosive meanings. The sociological perspective I develop claims that prices, price differences, and price changes convey multiple meanings related to the reputation of artists, the social status of dealers, and the quality of the artworks that are traded.},

This relationship is moderated by the house's inward centrality in a network of personnel mobility stemming from hiring competitors' employees, the tenure of its creative directors, the accomplishments of these directors, and the house's status. Our results suggest that organizations can enhance their creativity by relying on ideas obtained through relationships with their former employees long after these employees left to work for the competition. However, this effect is contingent upon characteristics of the organization that may be associated with its capacity to absorb these ideas and its ability to signal legitimacy of the resulting output to the external audiences.},

While there is a well-developed body of sociological knowledge on evaluation and classification processes, there has been little work to treat museums as an object of inquiry. Yet guidance from the multidisciplinary museum literature only offers an undersocialized view of these organizations. I argue that museums offer a rich opportunity to study how classification, cognition, and interaction unfold in a developed field, because valuation processes are related to aesthetics in a particularly rich way. A diverse group of museum professionals offer their perspectives on organizational quality. The study finds that art professionals make an extensive range of symbolic distinctions in their understanding of quality, some of which are shared. How individuals compare museums to one another illuminates implicit status hierarchies and classification biases in cognition. A unique contribution of this study lies in the explication of different kinds of interactions between museums. In doing so, this study adds depth to prior work on evaluation, and breadth to research on inter-organization relationships.},

Using the population of 617 international art collectors named by ARTnews, ArtReview, and Art+Auction from 1990 to 2011, I examine factors that affect the extent of a collector's recognition through naming on ARTnews's annual list of the world's top collectors. The research draws on both humanities and sociological perspectives to model two sets of characteristics that may affect the amount of critical recognition conferred on a collector. First, conceiving that recognition is based on the art object, status characteristics of art collections are considered. Next, characteristics of the art collection's owner (rather than the art objects themselves) are considered. Findings indicate that the extent of recognition a collector receives is based on both collection and collector attributes, even when holding the other constant. Notably, collections specializing in art originating from both culturally dominant and peripheral regions are favored with extended critical recognition, though only collectors residing in culturally dominant regions are consistently distinguished. Overall, results suggest that important overarching status characteristics of object and owner affect the extent to which elite taste and expertise are critically recognized, with the expectation that the greater the extent of recognition, the greater the validation.},

Using data on emerging artists in the field of contemporary art from 2001 to 2010, we investigate the manner in which artists' audience-specific reputations affect their subsequent success with two distinct audiences: museums and galleries. Our findings suggest that audience-specific reputations have systematically different effects with respect to success with museums and galleries. Our findings also illuminate the extent to which audience-specific reputations are relevant for emerging research on the contingent effects of reputation. In particular, our findings support our predictions that audiences differ from one another in terms of the extent to which other signals (specifically, status and interaction with other audiences) enhance or reduce the value of audience-specific reputations. Our study thus advances theory by providing empirical evidence for the value of incorporating audience-specific reputations into the general study of reputation.},

Although some of these disadvantages resemble gender inequalities in non-artistic work, such as lower pay, underrepresentation, work-family conflict, and symbolic devaluation, others are unique to artistic careers. In this essay, I extend Acker's work on the implicit gendering of the ideal-typical worker to show how gender implicitly organizes social expectations around artists and artistic work. I highlight themes emerging from past research on gender relations in artistic careers, which suggest that the ideal-typical artist builds on a masculine model in at least three ways. First, collective understandings of creative genius center a masculine subject. Second, bias in aesthetic evaluations systematically favors men over women. Third, the structure of artistic careers, particularly the need for entrepreneurial labor and self-promotion, requires artists to engage in behaviors that are more socially acceptable in men than in women.},

  abstract = {How do prices for contemporary art come into being? Buyers of contemporary art face a problem of fundamental uncertainty, because what passes as quality is difficult to determine, and buyers can hardly estimate how a specific piece of art will perform as an investment. Since a market for contemporary art presupposes the possibility of at least limited rational purchasing decisions, uncertainty must be reduced. We argue that the value of an art work or artist originates in an intersubjective process of assessment and conferring of reputation by experts in the art field, such as gallery owners, curators, critics, art dealers, journalists, and collectors, who help establish the artistic reputation of a work or an artist. The quality signals emerging from the art field enable buyers to assess the economic value of art works. We tested this initial hypothesis against two datasets containing data on art prices and information from the biographies of artists.},

The authors investigate the opportunities and barriers faced by emerging artists using a case study of a major contemporary art exhibition and its follow-up shows. Data from 20 interviews indicate that the exhibition is viewed as a useful steppingstone, offering such benefits as recognition and exposure, networking, marketing, and enhanced ambition and motivation. Only a few exhibiting artists receive monetary rewards from sales or prizes. The lack of financial assistance means that most artists are financially challenged. Artists also lack knowledge of market conditions and have a tendency to undervalue their art work. Nevertheless, many artists express no interest in developing commercial skills and have a pessimistic view of public funding. Some artists show signs of an anti-entrepreneurial mindset. The authors argue that permanent platforms are required in order to provide emerging artists with both tangible and emotional support (English)},

  shorttitle = {Towards a {{Structural Theory}} of {{Status Inequality}}},
  abstract = {In this paper, I use Aage S{\o}rensen's theory of structural inequality as a point of departure to develop a framework for understanding status in contemporary social life. Contrary to the view that status is now fragmented into a multiplicity of localized spaces of distinction, I argue that status structures, consisting of mutually-sustaining sets of cultural schemas and resources, are transposed in a wide variety of social situations in such a way that enduring patterns of inequality are reproduced over time and space. These status structures provide advantages which correspond to S{\o}rensen's earlier definition of rents as returns obtained from positions in social structure rather than from individual talent and effort. To illustrate the usefulness of this framework, I present two examples from my work in the sociology of culture. In a study of prestige among popular music artists in Quebec, I show that status schemas which appear to be context-specific are related to similar schemas found in other art fields, are not entirely detached from other dimensions of inequality, and provide advantages which are rents. In an exploratory study of tastes, I show how status structures can change over time in a way that reproduces existing inequalities. Drawing a parallel with the rhetoric of diversity expressed in a variety of fields, including economics, marketing, and politics, I argue that conspicuous openness to diversity may be emerging as one of the master cultural schemas of our times.},

It deals with the study of turning points in career paths in order to understand, first, the process of exclusion from the labor market, second, the increase in long-term unemployment over time. I mobilize the approach of economics of convention, which accounts for the processes of selection by focusing on moments of quality valuations in "tests" (valorizations and devalorizations). I use qualitative data from 60 biographical interviews with French unemployed people to build a typology of conventional labor worlds based on mixed methods: quantitative lexical analysis with the software ALCESTE and qualitative analysis of the interviews. The empirical analysis reveals the existence of plural logics of coordination and valuation of work's quality, which can be connected to the different segments of the labor market brought out by the labor market segmentation theory. The processes of exclusion differ from one segment to another and are the result of specific tests and of interactions with specific intermediaries. The "critical transitions" often stem from a tension between different registers of valuation. However, some experiences go beyond these discontinuities. Some changes in recruitment conventions, that become dominant, are at the origin of a "denial of evaluation" and of the development of an "unemployment of exclusion.".},

  abstract = {Traditionally, aestheticians and art historians consider artists and works within "the canon" as containing "genius" or "greatness" that sustains their reputations across time and space.   Shows like "In the Actors Studio" elevate particular professional actors to the status of "greatness," thereby reinforcing concepts of artistic genius as inherent in particular people.  The popular, along with internalist approaches to art tend to search for cultural universals within the intrinsic values of the artistic object or artist.  However, since the latter part of the 20th century, revisionist studies of artistic greatness, largely from the social sciences, have moved toward viewing what constitutes "greatness" as a social, political, and historical construction.   Social scientists challenge the internalist approach to artistic greatness by demonstrating how artistic canons and artistic "genius" are shaped by external, social processes.  This paper reviews the various literatures that approach artistic concepts of "greatness" from a sociological perspective and examines empirically, based on personally-conducted interview data, how artists, specifically professional actors, construct a "great" performance. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript},

International research across a range of industries reveals gendered patterns of disadvantage and exclusion which are, unsurprisingly, further complicated by divisions of class, and also disability and race and ethnicity. These persistent inequalities are amplified by the precariousness, informality and requirements for flexibility which are widely noted features of contemporary creative employment. In addition, women in particular are disadvantaged by the boundary-crossing (for instance, between home and work, paid work and unpaid work) and new pressures around identity-making and self-presentation, as well as continuing difficulties related to sexism and the need to manage parenting responsibilities alongside earning. This article introduces a new collection which explores these issues, marking the significance of gender for an understanding of creative labour in the neoliberal economy.},

  abstract = {Using a unique hand-collected dataset, comprising all artwork sales in Italy between 2006 and 2010, we test Rosen's and Adler's hypotheses in the modern and contemporary visual art market. We extract our measures of artist talent and fame from a set of observable artist-specific variables by means of a factor analysis and estimate the elasticities of income with respect to talent and fame. Consistent with Rosen's and Adler's hypotheses, our results suggest a convex relationship between income and talent and a linear relationship between income and fame. Using SUR models to evaluate the effects of artist talent and fame on the average trade prices and number of sales, we find that the number of artwork sales is the main 'channel' through which talent and fame influence income. Copula models provide additional insights on the nature of the conditional dependence relationship between average prices and number of sales. Poolability tests suggest a single model of artist income applies to all artists in our dataset whether their works are generally traded in auction houses or galleries, so it is not necessary to specify different models. Finally, quantile regressions reveal that artists in low-income quantiles are not superstars, Rosen's hypothesis holds only above the median income, and fame plays no role for low-income quantiles.},

  abstract = {An overview of the art historical antecedents to virtual reality and the impact of virtual reality on contemporary conceptions of art.Although many people view virtual reality as a totally new phenomenon, it has its foundations in an unrecognized history of immersive images. Indeed, the search for illusionary visual space can be traced back to antiquity. In this book, Oliver Grau shows how virtual art fits into the art history of illusion and immersion. He describes the metamorphosis of the concepts of art and the image and relates those concepts to interactive art, interface design, agents, telepresence, and image evolution. Grau retells art history as media history, helping us to understand the phenomenon of virtual reality beyond the hype.Grau shows how each epoch used the technical means available to produce maximum illusion. He discusses frescoes such as those in the Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii and the gardens of the Villa Livia near Primaporta, Renaissance and Baroque illusion spaces, and panoramas, which were the most developed form of illusion achieved through traditional methods of painting and the mass image medium before film. Through a detailed analysis of perhaps the most important German panorama, Anton von Werner's 1883 The Battle of Sedan, Grau shows how immersion produced emotional responses. He traces immersive cinema through Cinerama, Sensorama, Expanded Cinema, 3-D, Omnimax and IMAX, and the head mounted display with its military origins. He also examines those characteristics of virtual reality that distinguish it from earlier forms of illusionary art. His analysis draws on the work of contemporary artists and groups ART+COM, Maurice Benayoun, Charlotte Davies, Monika Fleischmann, Ken Goldberg, Agnes Hegedues, Eduardo Kac, Knowbotic Research, Laurent Mignonneau, Michael Naimark, Simon Penny, Daniela Plewe, Paul Sermon, Jeffrey Shaw, Karl Sims, Christa Sommerer, and Wolfgang Strauss. Grau offers not just a history of illusionary space but also a theoretical framework for analyzing its phenomenologies, functions, and strategies throughout history and into the future.},

Specifically, the demand for the absolute freedom of artistic expression and the proscription of judgment in the philosophy of avantgarde create a situation in which decisions cannot be based on established criteria. Consequently, such decisions are sought after in the "social reality" of the inner circle of the avantgarde. None of the approaches underlying various figurative styles, in contrast, require absolute openness. The availability of specific criteria for evaluating figurative art renders a similar reliance on "social reality" unnecessary and, accordingly, individual judgment prevails in "gatekeeping" choices. In the Israeli art world, avantgarde and figurative art coexist in two exclusive subsystems and thus provide a unique opportunity to observe in high relief the patterns of judgment characteristic of each.]},

Before their style of working went out of fashion in the 1930s, all the artists studied had been recognized as painter-etchers, but few had achieved a level of renown that guaranteed the preservation of their original oeuvres, a condition that, in the instance of visual artists, is a sine qua non for being remembered. Where such preservation was not assured, the posthumous durability of reputation depended on the artist's own lifetime efforts to protect or project that reputation, survivors with a stake in preserving or enhancing the artist's reputation, linkages to networks facilitating entry into the cultural archives, and retrospective interest leading to the rediscovery of the artist as the symbolic representative of emerging cultural or political identities. Similar conditions for remembering exist in other areas of culture production; these are affected by the rate at which "old" work loses relevance, the nature of the creative achievement, and the medium in which it is preserved.},

In contrast to Bourdieu's emphasis on aesthetic knowledge and tastes. I propose that culture's importance for class cohesion, at least in the American context, is rooted in the social organization of elite participation in the arts. Thus, the link that cultural capital theory draws between the arts and class cohesion is correct, but it occurs through an alternative mechanism.

  abstract = {[This research examines the effects of contemporaneous critical, professional, and popular recognition, as well as the effects of the extent of subsequent critical discourse about films and their directors, on the retrospective cultural consecration of American films. Specifically, it examines a sample of 1,277 films released from 1929 to 1991 that received three or more major Academy Award nominations or were selected among the ten best films of the year by either the New York Times or the National Board of Review or were among the top ten films in terms of box-office revenues in a given year. The analysis focuses on the characteristics of those films that were retrospectively consecrated either by inclusion among the 100 greatest films by the American Film Institute or by inclusion in the National Film Registry. Contemporaneous professional and recognition of the director of a film is especially important in determining the likelihood of retrospective consecration. In addition, the extent of critical discourse both about a film and about its director is important in determining the likelihood of retrospective consecration. Overall, the findings confirm that the retrospective consecration of films is affected by the discourse produced by film critics and scholars who function, in effect, as reputational entrepreneurs. However, this discourse is influenced by the availability of certain cultural schemas. Specifically, the ascendancy of "auteur theory" as a discourse of value within film studies serves to privilege the director as the primary creative agent in film production. It also serves to privilege certain directors over others.]},

  abstract = {According to Pierre Bourdieu's analysis, the emergence of the literary field results from a historical process by which the literary activity became autonomous from different types of external constraints, related to the conditions of production. This paper gives a provisional account of these types of constraints, focusing on the French case. It is possible to class the national literary fields according to their dependence upon the State or upon the market. In authoritarian regimes, the State is an instrument of control put at the service of an ideological system. The ideological demand determines the supply of cultural goods. It implies a strict regulation of economic exchanges, a centralisation of the means of production and consecration. The liberalization of the bookmarket has favoured the literary field's relative liberation from State control. But the market has also constraints of its own, mainly profit, which encloses, for literature, the risk of standardization. During the 19th Century, writers claimed for the autonomy of literary recognition, that must be grounded on aesthetical judgments and not on sales. In France, the State progressively became committed to help literary activities preserve a certain degree of autonomy from the market.},

This hierarchy of fame may be empirically studied by means of the mentions technique. In this article, the cohort of writers born 1825\textendash{}1849, mainly consisting of realists and naturalists, is studied as it enters, dominates and vanishes from the frames of reference of Swedish daily reviewers in the 1880s and the postwar period. Considerable similarity is found between the cohort's hierarchies of fame in the 1880s and the postwar period. This similarity demonstrates the power of journalistic critics in shaping the literary frame of reference of the future. The influence of the reviewers must have been relayed by essayists and academics in the periods between the 1880s and our time. The continued, comparative study of this dynamic process of cooperation and competition between the three types of literary critics will yield an increased understanding of the whole `field of literature'.},

The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science\textemdash{}a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent (50).},

  abstract = {This article analyzes how social network structures affect career success in a projectbased labor market. The literature on team success has shown that teams perform well if they integrate both weak and strong ties simultaneously. Applying the literature to careers in the creative industries, the study suggests that creative artists are more likely to receive critical recognition if they build their careers in both familiar project networks and heterogeneous sets of creative conventions. It is argued that familiarity and diversity operate as complementary elements in the development of innovative ideas. While diversity is important to maximize the flow of new ideas, it needs to be embedded within trustworthy and familiar network structures in order to fully develop its creative potential. The suggested mechanism is tested by means of full career data of 55,097 film directors, covering 478,859 directing jobs in 330,142 film productions during the years 1900\textendash{}2010. It is shown that familiarity and diversity explain a considerable part of a director's critical success. Results from interaction effects show that diversity has greater effects on critical success if it is socially embedded within familiar social structures.

  abstract = {By examining trends in intra-organizational and inter-organizational job transition probabilities among professional and managerial employees in Germany, we test the applicability of mainstream career theory to a specific context and challenge its implied change assumption. Drawing on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), we apply linear probability models to show the influence of time, economic cycle and age on the probability of job transitions between 1984 and 2010. Results indicate a slight negative trend in the frequency of job transitions during the analyzed time span, owing to a pronounced decrease in intra-organizational transitions, which is only partly offset by a comparatively weaker positive trend towards increased inter-organizational transitions. The latter is strongly influenced by fluctuations in the economic cycle. Finally, the probability of job transitions keeps declining steadily through the course of one's working life. In contrast to inter-organizational transitions, however, this age effect for intra-organizational transitions has decreased over time.,

Are there quantifiable patterns behind a successful scientific career? Sinatra et al. analyzed the publications of 2887 physicists, as well as data on scientists publishing in a variety of fields. When productivity (which is usually greatest early in the scientist's professional life) is accounted for, the paper with the greatest impact occurs randomly in a scientist's career. However, the process of generating a high-impact paper is not an entirely random one. The authors developed a quantitative model of impact, based on an element of randomness, productivity, and a factor Q that is particular to each scientist and remains constant during the scientist's career.
Science, this issue p. 596
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONIn most areas of human performance, from sport to engineering, the path to a major accomplishment requires a steep learning curve and long practice. Science is not that different: Outstanding discoveries are often preceded by publications of less memorable impact. However, despite the increasing desire to identify early promising scientists, the temporal career patterns that characterize the emergence of scientific excellence remain unknown.
RATIONALEHow do impact and productivity change over a scientific career? Does impact, arguably the most relevant performance measure, follow predictable patterns? Can we predict the timing of a scientist's outstanding achievement? Can we model, in quantitative and predictive terms, scientific careers? Driven by these questions, here we quantify the evolution of impact and productivity throughout thousands of scientific careers. We do so by reconstructing the publication record of scientists from seven disciplines, associating to each paper its long-term impact on the scientific community, as quantified by citation metrics.
RESULTSWe find that the highest-impact work in a scientist's career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work can be, with the same probability, anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist\textemdash{}it could be the first publication, could appear mid-career, or could be a scientist's last publication. This random-impact rule holds for scientists in different disciplines, with different career lengths, working in different decades, and publishing solo or with teams and whether credit is assigned uniformly or unevenly among collaborators.The random-impact rule allows us to develop a quantitative model, which systematically untangles the role of productivity and luck in each scientific career. The model assumes that each scientist selects a project with a random potential p and improves on it with a factor Qi, resulting in a publication of impact Qip. The parameter Qi captures the ability of scientist i to take advantage of the available knowledge in a way that enhances (Qi {$>$} 1) or diminishes (Qi {$<$} 1) the potential impact p of a paper. The model predicts that truly high-impact discoveries require a combination of high Q and luck (p) and that increased productivity alone cannot substantially enhance the chance of a very high impact work. We also show that a scientist's Q, capturing her sustained ability to publish high-impact papers, is independent of her career stage. This is in contrast with all current metrics of excellence, from the total number of citations to the h-index, which increase with time. The Q model provides an analytical expression of these traditional impact metrics and allows us to predict their future time evolution for each individual scientist, being also predictive of independent recognitions, like Nobel prizes.
CONCLUSIONThe random-impact rule and the Q parameter, representing two fundamental characteristics of a scientific career, offer a rigorous quantitative framework to explore the evolution of individual careers and understand the emergence of scientific excellence. Such understanding could help us better gauge scientific performance and offers a path toward nurturing high-impact scientists, potentially informing future policy decisions. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/354/6312/aaf5239/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Random-impact rule.The publication history of two Nobel laureates, Frank A.

Each vertical line corresponds to a research paper. The height of each line corresponds to paper impact, quantified with the number of citations the paper received after 10 years.

Wilczek is reprinted with permission of STS/Society for Science \& the Public. Image of John B. Fenn is available for public domain use on Wikipedia.org.]
Despite the frequent use of numerous quantitative indicators to gauge the professional impact of a scientist, little is known about how scientific impact emerges and evolves in time. Here, we quantify the changes in impact and productivity throughout a career in science, finding that impact, as measured by influential publications, is distributed randomly within a scientist's sequence of publications. This random-impact rule allows us to formulate a stochastic model that uncouples the effects of productivity, individual ability, and luck and unveils the existence of universal patterns governing the emergence of scientific success. The model assigns a unique individual parameter Q to each scientist, which is stable during a career, and it accurately predicts the evolution of a scientist's impact, from the h-index to cumulative citations, and independent recognitions, such as prizes.
Productivity, ability, and luck are incorporated into an algorithm describing a scientist's impact.

  abstract = {Today's public discourse on art revolves around the price of these priceless goods and numbers function as ciphers for the collective representations of art and its status in late capitalist society. Highly contrary assessments as to how the prices for these goods can be found, depending on the perspective taken. While it may seem that optimal transparency exists with regard to the market and the setting of prices, thanks to commercial databases readily available to everyone, ethnographic field work presents quite a different view. A research group took the question on pricing to a particularly prominent institution of the art market, Art Basel, using a variety of methodological approaches such as qualitative interviews with gallerists, artists, Art Basel staff, curators, art advisors, art critics etc. In the interviews someunwritten rules for dealing with the pricing of works of art became apparent. Pricing in the field of art requires not just knowledge of the unwritten and often tabooed rules, but also an intuitive feeling for the game and the accompanying strategies. Our empirical findings confirm the existence of two different paradigms. One the one hand there is the image of pure market competition for singular goods with high prestige value. In this view, the pricing of art commodities seems determined in an ideal-typical manner by purely exogenous market-dynamic and competition-driven forces. On the other hand, the idea of a purely endogenous, ``art-immanent'' reading and appreciation of the intrinsic value of a concrete work of art is maintained, independently of its real or potential market value .},

In Finland, census data are no longer gathered by questionnaires but are derived direct from official registers, which causes particular problems in the case of artists who in many respects differ from the standard salary earner. The data tend to reflect current legislation and administrative practices rather than people's subjective conceptions. Some census variables prove to be useless for research purposes. The census data nonetheless offer unique opportunities for horizontal and vertical comparisons. To serve the needs of artist researchers the data have to be partially de- and reconstructed; e.g., the identification of artists may be improved by reclassifying the original uncoded occupational titles coming from the various registers. The production of occupation data is so laborious that the census cannot meet the urgent needs of policymakers. Methodological triangulation, supplementing census data with targeted questionnaires and interviews, is suggested for the monitoring of the status of artists.},

  shorttitle = {How to Identify Artists?},
  abstract = {This article confronts the problem of defining the population for large-scale empirical studies of contemporary artists. The focus is on one special category, here identified as 'status-of-the-artist' (SA) studies. This term refers to surveys of professional artists' social and economic conditions, usually commissioned by public arts administration bodies or artists' associations. Empirically the article draws on a research project carried out at the Arts Council of Finland in 1985\textendash{}1996. Various methods of identifying the artist are examined, with a special emphasis on their presuppositions and their subsequent influence on findings. The Finnish project serves as a definitional laboratory. Findings from this project, consistent with reports from other countries, indicate that a universal solution to the problem hardly exists, but the criteria for the artist have to be tailored individually for each purpose and context. There is no neutral way of defining the artist either, especially within the art-political setting where a definition has concrete effects on the allocation of scarce resources. For a more reflective approach, it is suggested that the researcher explore the role of definitions in the actual art worlds. This provides a context-sensitive basis for constructing an optimal definition and an operationalisation of the artist. It also helps in guarding against the unintended adoption of partisan views and involvement in art politics. By analysing the different real-world definitions, their advocates, and their implications in the distribution of social and economic rewards it is feasible to learn much about the actual status of the artist, the very subject of our study.},

In the model, actors reproduce status hierarchies by adjusting their own status-conferring gestures according to collective attributions. These collective attributions are just the aggregate of individual gestures, leading to a self-reinforcing status ranking. Winner-take-all hierarchies are discouraged, however, when people prefer reciprocation of their status-conferring actions. The model therefore depicts a status ranking as an equilibrium resulting from individual responses to the trade-off between social influence and the distaste for making unreciprocated gestures. Analysis of the model generates several precise predictions about the patterns that social networks should exhibit at equilibrium. Data on interaction in task groups, friendship ratings in a fraternity, and play in a set of infant quintuplets is used to show that the formal theory makes unusually accurate predictions about network structure.},

These predictions are analyzed in the American auto industry during 1895\textendash{}1912 when special-purpose product rating agencies were absent and reliability and speed contests served as credentialing devices. The results show that cumulative victories in contests extend the life chances of winning organizations but there is no evidence that new startup organizations benefit more than lateral entries.

Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of ``explanation'' that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage.},

Centrality within this network captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions.

The present article explores the analytical payoffs of looking at consecration as a populationlevel phenomenon, that is, as the delineation of clear-cut divides between the chosen and the rest in a population of candidates. This approach, I argue, brings out the unique character of consecration as an abstract process of status formation: It enhances the perceived worth of the consecrated, not by confirming that they are individually worthy, but by asserting the existence in a field of a reliable hierarchy of worthiness. A population-level approach also implies that consecrating institutions derive some of their authority from the forcefulness of the divides they draw between elected individuals and others. The article shows how this explains some of the salient features of retrospective consecration projects. To make these points I analyze cases of consecration in a variety of empirical domains, from politics to the arts, sports, and religion.},

When I am traveling, I am always on the move, but when I return home I spend twenty-four hours in bed, I eat nothing, I drink only water. It is the same in my work. After a series of calm austere pictures there will by colorful dynamic ones. Yes, indeed, one can speak of cycles in my painting.'' \textemdash{}Joan Mir{\'o}, Selected Writings and Interviews, 1970 The largest and most comprehensive exhibition ever held in the United States of the work of the Catalan master Joan Mir{\'o} (1893\textendash{}1983) , Joan Mir{\'o} celebrates the 100th anniversary of the artist's birth with some 400 works in virtually all the mediums he employed. The exhibition is the first major survey to examine the artist's pervasive tendency to work in series, and represents nearly all of his major cycles. Joan Mir{\'o} thus examines the full range of Mir{\'o}'s oeuvre, offering an unprecedented opportunity to chart the development of one of the twentieth-century's most innovative artists, as well as providing insight into the creative process itself. Joan Mir{\'o}, which can only be seen in New York, is installed chronologically on both levels of the Museum's temporary exhibition galleries. It comprises more than 150 paintings, as well as drawings, prints, sculptures, ceramics, and illustrated books, assembled from public and private collections from throughout the world. Among the many series represented is the group of so-called dream paintings from the 1920s, twenty-one of which are included in the exhibition. All twenty-three works of the Constellation series of 1940\textendash{}41, a pivotal group of paintings on paper that shows the artist at the height of his career, are exhibited together for the first time. Also included is a selection of works left in Mir{\'o}'s studio at his death. These paintings, of an often startling expressivity, have never been seen in the United States. Joan Mir{\'o} begins in 1915, with paintings that predate the artist's first trip to Paris. A number of Mir{\'o}'s experiments with avant-garde pictorial styles, such as the Cezannist ``La Publicidad'' and Flower Vase (1917) and the Fauve-inspired Portrait of Enric Crist{\`o}fol Ricart (1917), are included in this section. Such works illustrate the development of a personal style which challenges both traditional and vanguard artistic values. The paintings Mir{\'o} executed after visiting Paris for the first time, including Still Life with Rabbit (The Table) (1920\textendash{}21) and Horse, Pipe, and Red Flower (Still Life with Horse) (1920), continue to reflect the tension between the artist's attempts to forge a style out of the conflicting currents of modernism and his own deeply felt Catalan identity. Mir{\'o} maintained that his paintings were rooted in nature and his native land\textemdash{}in particular, the family farm at Montroig. His early masterpiece, The Farm (1921\textendash{}22), sets down in meticulous detail the life of the farm in Montroig and is a perfect example of what curator Carolyn Lanchner calls the artist's ``ardent desire to reveal the marvelous in the quotidian,'' a desire that was the driving force behind his long career. Beginning in 1925, Mir{\'o} began to plan blocks of work in advance, grouping drawings from the pages of his notebook into predetermined series. He once compared his working methods to those of a gardener: ``I think of my studio as a vegetable garden. Here, there are artichokes, there potatoes.\ldots{} Things follow their natural course. They grow, they ripen. You have to graft. You have to water, as you do for lettuce. Things ripen in my mind. In addition, I always work on a great many things at once.'' Mir{\'o}'s series are not based upon variations on a single theme or motif or permutations of a given set of elements, but rather are defined by a consistent conceptual grouping. This is obvious in the sequence of remarkable ``dream'' paintings of 1925 to 1927. These paintings, in which recognizable imagery gives way to schematic lines and opaque shapes held in suspension against loosely brushed and monochromatic grounds, have frequently been seen as exemplars of Surrealist automatism. Yet Mir{\'o}'s notebook studies for these works, a selection of which are shown here alongside the paintings for the first time in this country, demonstrate that they are far from products of the unfettered unconscious. Nonetheless, they provided the model for both the free, gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism and a new and open pictorial spatiality that has come to be known as ``color-field'' painting. By 1930 Mir{\'o} told his friend Sebastia Gasch that he was ready to bid a ``farewell'' to painting; and, indeed, for the next two years, his energies were increasingly devoted to assemblages and constructions incorporating such untraditional materials as shells, mirror, rock, and nails. But this flurry of object making was succeeded by an emphatic return to painting in 1932 with a series of small oils on wood of jewel-like precision and radiant color. The following year he created a series of large canvases of elusive mystery. Based on small, utterly mundane collages Mir{\'o} made from the clipped-out images of ordinary objects, these works offer a vivid illustration of how he gave form to the ever coincident realities of the visual and the imaginary worlds. The political climate of the times and the Civil War in Spain made the latter half of the 1930s a turbulent period for Mir{\'o}. On a visit to Paris in late 1936, he found himself unable to return to Spain and thereafter lived in involuntary exile in France until mid-1940. During 1937 and early 1938, he stopped working in series and produced two paintings stylistically unique in his oeuvre, and utterly different from each other: Still Life with Old Shoe and Self-Portrait I. With the subsequent Self-Portrait II, Mir{\'o} was sufficiently established to resume his customary working habits. Hoping to escape the threat of imminent war, Mir{\'o} settled in the small village of Varengeville on the coast of Normandy. There, in 1940, he began a series of twenty-three paintings, mostly in gouache and oil, on uniform sheets of paper. His work on the paintings, collectively known as the Constellations, was soon disrupted by the Nazi advance on France, and he and his family sought refuge in Palma de Mallorca. There, Mir{\'o} continued working on the series; he completed the last three at the farm in Montroig. Within the precisely articulated lines of these small-scale works, the artist compressed the whole of his knowledge and vision, giving the paintings a sense of immensity despite their small size. He wrote, ``When I was painting the Constellations, I had the genuine feeling that I was working in secret, but it was a liberation for me in that I ceased thinking about the tragedy all around me.'' By the end of the war, in works such as Women Listening to Music (1945), Mir{\'o} had established the calligraphic, magical imagery of women, birds, stars, and wiry figures for which he was to become renowned. He returned to poetic, whimsical titles, such as The Bird Boom-Boom Makes His Appeal to the Head Onion Peel (1952), which recall his early ``painting-poems'' of the 1920s. From the 1940s through 1960, Mir{\'o} focused increasingly on sculpture, ceramics, and printmaking; from the late 1940s on, he was involved in a number of public commissions, including murals and sculptures executed on a monumental scale. A representative sampling of this work in the exhibition includes Moonbird (1966), which is over seven feet tall, and Mural Painting (1950\textendash{}51), which, commissioned for a Harvard University dining room, measures nearly twenty feet in length. By the late 1950s, Mir{\'o} was able to secure the enormous studio he had always wanted, in Palma de Mallorca. Here he executed most of the exhibition's large-scale canvases. In their scale and sense of expansiveness, such works as the Blue I, Blue II, and Blue III triptych of 1961 may be seen as Mir{\'o}'s response to American Abstract Expressionism combined with his own prior innovations in the early ``dream'' paintings. During the last full decade of his life, Mir{\'o} executed a large number of paintings that were freer and more gestural than ever before. In the paintings from the 1970s included in the exhibition, there is a sense of foreboding, urgency, and unseen danger which strikes an emotional chord unique in the artist's career. Like Picasso's late paintings, they reflect Mir{\'o}'s struggle to deal with mortality, yet their unabated energy betrays no diminishment of his artistic will, or of his need to give form to the joy and predicament of life. As Ms. Lanchner writes, ``In whatever medium he worked, Mir{\'o}'s intent was\ldots{}'to rediscover the sources of human feeling.'''},

The labor market for feature-film actors is analyzed via career patterns recorded in the Internet Movie Database and interviews with key informants, allowing the article to distinguish between typecasting effects and those due to underlying skill differences or social networks.

The optimal regression-based test is easily computed as the t-test from an auxiliary regression.

We further demonstrate that FE models are extremely sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags.

  title = {Figures of {{Purity}}: {{Consecration}}, {{Exclusion}}, and {{Segregated Inclusion}} in {{Cultural Settings}}},
  shorttitle = {Figures of {{Purity}}},
  abstract = {Like many sociologists, I am perplexed by the fact that in meritocratic societies, individuals whose abilities or talent does not differ widely nevertheless enjoy considerably different levels of achievement and success. The present dissertation seeks to uncover some of the reasons behind such non-meritocratic inequality.
      There are two main approaches one can take to that problem. The first and more classical one consists in observing inequality that matters \textendash{} inequality in earnings or career prospects for example \textendash{} and to show that such inequality can be traced back to broad categorical attributes such as class, gender, or race and ethnicity. This is not the approach I follow here. Rather, I strategically select cases that make it possible to uncover the fine-grained processes and mechanisms generative of non-meritocratic inequality.
      Among these ``pure'' cases are art worlds \textendash{} winner-take-all settings typically marked by high inequality, and where success is often vastly disconnected from merit or intrinsic quality. The first part of this dissertation focuses on one such art world as a laboratory for studying the social processes underlying the formation of economic value, and therefore the formation of inequality in economic success.
      CONSECRATION AS A SOCIAL PROCESS OF VALUATION
      My approach to success and inequality rests on the intuition that we can partially explain them by studying social processes of valuation, i.e. processes that shape the value of things or individuals without affecting their underlying differences in ability, merit, performance, or talent. In the first two chapters this dissertation, I outline and test a theory of one such process, namely consecration.
      The first chapter develops a structural definition of consecration that makes possible to study its occurrence, conditions, and consequences in a variety of social settings. The chief features of that definition are identified using a series of empirical instances of consecration. The chapter then shows how that definition can be operationalized with simple network concepts, and suggests a network-based strategy for capturing consecration empirically \textendash{} in art worlds for example. The chapter finally draws testable implications from that definition, and explores its relationship with the notion of retrospective consecration.
      The second chapter uses that notion of consecration to solve an empirical puzzle in the sociology of valuation. Markets for unique and novel goods are often seen as privileged settings for the powerful influence of market intermediaries: when quality is uncertain, or when it lacks definition altogether, intermediaries can play a crucial role in signaling or specifying it, thereby ultimately shaping the prices consumers are willing to pay for products. Products, meanwhile, do not get much more unique or novel than in the market for contemporary art. Yet economic sociologists have repeatedly failed to observe any influence of art market intermediaries on the value of the artists they distribute.
      This puzzling finding, I argue, arises from a misconception of how intermediaries shape the value of artists. We usually think of intermediation as acting through two chief processes of valuation: credentialing, or the signaling of unobservable quality, and qualification, or the establishment of specific quality criteria. Yet I suggest that it also can influence value through consecration, or the structural signaling of the existence of quality differences in a population. Using the market for modern art in early twentieth-century Paris as an empirical backdrop, this chapter shows that intermediation as consecration, not credentialing or qualification, was indeed how art market intermediaries shaped the value of their artists in the heyday of French modern painting.
      SOCIAL PROCESSES OF VALUATION AND ELITE CONSOLIDATION IN GILDED AGE AMERICA
      The remaining chapter is a logical development of the previous two. It builds on the fine-grained insights they offer \textendash{} on social processes of valuation, and on the mechanisms of non-meritocratic inequality more generally \textendash{} to address larger-scale issues of social inequality and social reproduction.
      The chapter uses a new database of subscribers to the New York Philharmonic to understand how cultural participation cemented the status \textendash{} or social value \textendash{} of elites in Gilded Age America. The database has information on who subscribed to the Philharmonic between 1880 and 1910 \textendash{} a period of huge upheaval, of threats to the dominance of traditional elites, and ultimately of elite consolidation in the United States, and in the city of New York in particular. In analyzing these data I seek to understand how culture worked as an elite resource in that era.
      The classic account of culture and elite consolidation posits that the formation of an upper class and its continued dominance rest on a mechanism of exclusion. In this view, cultural participation reinforces elites by setting them apart \textendash{} a process akin to consecration as I delineate it in earlier chapters.
      My work on the Philharmonic challenges that classic view. For the distinctiveness associated with elite cultural endeavors to reinforce elite dominance, I argue, these endeavors have to happen against a backdrop of general agreement over their value. In Gilded Age New York, this agreement happened not through exclusion, but through the inclusion of a group of cultural experts into the cultural institutions championed by the social elite. The inclusion of that cultured group served to testify to the quality of the cultural endeavors of the social elite, and provided them with a stamp of cultural legitimacy. In other words, it valued the elite through a process of credentialing.
      The second analytical contribution of that final chapter has to do with class consolidation and the reproduction of upper class dominance more generally. While consolidation is often seen as happening through exclusion and closure, I argue that in a context of rapid social differentiation, marked by the emergence of new areas of expertise, maintaining dominance does not necessarily involve barring access to outside groups. It can also mean being flexible enough to include the experts in emerging spheres. To remain atop the social hierarchy, elites may benefit from incorporating external elements that testify to their own continued relevance. Such inclusion is not necessarily full integration \textendash{} instead, I show that at the Philharmonic it involved a built-in mechanism of protection, namely segregation. Hence cultural experts were included to help reify and support upper class status and social power, but in a segregated fashion to protect the upper class from threats of destabilization.
      Finally, a word on title: the notion of purity is the recurring motif in this work. It conveys ideas of social exclusion and social closure, as deployed in the third chapter. When thought about in relational terms, purity may also refer to one's absence of ties to others whom one does not wish to be associated with in the public eye. This relational take on purity has strong affinities with the idea of consecration developed in chapters one and two. As a heuristic tool for the sociological imagination, purity is the thread that connects all the dots in this dissertation.},

While we estimate the average increase in wages resulting from union employment to be in excess of 20\% we find that the return to unobserved heterogeneity operating through union status is substantial and that the union premium is highly variable. We also find that the premium is sensitive to the form of sorting allowed in estimation. Moreover, the data are consistent with comparative advantage sorting. Our results suggest that the unobserved heterogeneity which positively contributes to the likelihood of union membership is associated with higher wages. We are unable, however, to determine whether this is due to the ability of these workers to extract monopoly rents or whether it reflects the more demanding hiring standards of employers faced by union wages. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  issn = {0002-9149},
  abstract = {Considerable attention has been devoted to the effect of social support on patient outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, little is known about the relation between patient living arrangements and outcomes. Thus, we used data from PREMIER, a registry of patients hospitalized with AMI at 19 United States centers from 2003 through 2004, to assess the association of living alone with outcomes after AMI. Outcome measurements included 4-year mortality, 1-year readmission, and 1-year health status using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the Short Form-12 Physical Health Component scales. Patients who lived alone had higher crude 4-year mortality (21.8\% vs 14.5\%, p {$<$}0.001) but comparable rates of 1-year readmission (41.6\% vs 38.3\%, p = 0.79). Living alone was associated with lower unadjusted quality of life (mean SAQ -2.40, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -4.44 to -0.35, p = 0.02) but had no impact on Short Form-12 Physical Health Component (-0.45, 95\% CI -1.65 to 0.76, p = 0.47) compared to patients who did not live alone. After multivariable adjustment, patients who lived alone had a comparable risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.93) and readmission (hazard ratio 0.99, 95\% CI 0.76 to 1.28) as patients who lived with others. Mean quality-of-life scores remained lower in patients who lived alone (SAQ -2.91, 95\% CI -5.56 to -0.26, p = 0.03). In conclusion, living alone may be associated with poorer angina-related quality of life 1 year after MI but is not associated with mortality, readmission, or other health status measurements after adjusting for other patient and treatment characteristics.},

  abstract = {A seminal work in health economics first published in 1972, Michael Grossman's \emph{The Demand for Health} introduced a new theoretical model for determining the health status of the population. His work uniquely synthesized economic and public health knowledge and has catalyzed a vastly influential body of health economics literature. It is well past time to bring this important work back into print.Grossman bases his approach on Gary S. Becker's household production function model and his theory of investment in human capital. Consumers demand health, which can include illness-free days in a given year or life expectancy, and then produce it through the input of medical care services, diet, other market goods and services, and time. Grossman also treats health and knowledge as equal parts of the durable stock of human capital. Consumers therefore have an incentive to invest in health to increase their earnings in the future. From here, Grossman examines complementarities between health capital and other forms of human capital, the most important of which is knowledge capital earned through schooling and its effect on the efficiency of production. He concludes that the rate of return on investing in health by increasing education may exceed the rate of return on investing in health through greater medical care. Higher income may not lead to better health outcomes, as wealth enables the consumption of goods and services with adverse health effects. These are some of the major revelations of Grossman's model, findings that have great relevance as we struggle to understand the links between poverty, education, structural disadvantages, and health.},

The early development in human capital theory, to which Becker was one of the main contributors, had obvious implications to the analysis of expenditures on health, but were almost exclusively focused on schooling and training (Schultz 1960; Becker 1962, 1964). Human capital theory advanced the idea that actions that imply present costs but enhanced individual productivity in the future could be seen as investments in a form of capital. Expenditures in health had many dimensions where such trade-offs were present. A good diet or exercising might not be very much fun, but potentially delivered long-term benefits in the form of a longer and healthier life. Preventive medical care demanded time and money, but might also improve future health prospects. This was recognized early on (Mushkin, 1962), but the first explorations of health as human capital were conceptually timid and did not give the field a push that remotely resembled that received by the economic research on education. For the years that followed, health economics persisted mostly as a field dealing with the analysis of health systems and delivery of health technologies.},

  title = {The {{Basic Theory}} of {{Human Capital}}},
  abstract = {One of the most important ideas in labor economics is to think of the set of marketable skills of workers as a form of capital in which workers make a variety of investments. This perspective is important in understanding both investment incentives, and the structure of wages and earnings. Loosely speaking, human capital corresponds to any stock of knowledge or characteristics the worker has (either innate or acquired) that contributes to his or her " productivity ". This definition is broad, and this has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are clear: it enables us to think of not only the years of schooling, but also of a variety of other characteristics as part of human capital investments. These include school quality, training, attitudes towards work, etc. Using this type of reasoning, we can make some progress towards understanding some of the differences in earnings across workers that are not accounted by schooling differences alone. The disadvantages are also related. At some level, we can push this notion of human capital too far, and think of every difference in remuneration that we observe in the labor market as due to human capital. For example, if I am paid less than another Ph.D., that must be because I have lower " skills " in some other dimension that's not being measured by my years of schooling\textendash{}this is the famous (or infamous) unobserved heterogeneity issue. The presumption that all pay differences are related to skills (even if these skills are unobserved to the economists in the standard data sets) is not a bad place to start when we want to impose a conceptual structure on 3},

For this study, investments in human capital include such factors as educational level, on-the-job skills training, health care, migration, and consideration of issues regarding regional prices and income.  Taking into account varying cultures and political regimes, the research indicates that economic earnings tend to be positively correlated to education and skill level.  Additionally, studies indicate an inverse correlation between education and unemployment.          Presents a theoretical overview of the types of human capital and the impact of investment in human capital on earnings and rates of return. Then utilizes empirical data and research to analyze the theoretical issues related to investment in human capital, specifically formal education.  Considered are such issues as costs and returns of investments, and social and private gains of individuals.  The research compares and contrasts these factors based upon both education and skill level.

  abstract = {Purpose
To examine the impact of marital status on stage at diagnosis, use of definitive therapy, and cancer-specific mortality among each of the 10 leading causes of cancer-related death in the United States.

Methods
We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program to identify 1,260,898 patients diagnosed in 2004 through 2008 with lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, prostate, liver/intrahepatic bile duct, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, head/neck, ovarian, or esophageal cancer. We used multivariable logistic and Cox regression to analyze the 734,889 patients who had clinical and follow-up information available.

Results
Married patients were less likely to present with metastatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.84; P {$<$} .001), more likely to receive definitive therapy (adjusted OR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.51 to 1.56; P {$<$} .001), and less likely to die as a result of their cancer after adjusting for demographics, stage, and treatment (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.79 to 0.81; P {$<$} .001) than unmarried patients. These associations remained significant when each individual cancer was analyzed (P {$<$} .05 for all end points for each malignancy). The benefit associated with marriage was greater in males than females for all outcome measures analyzed (P {$<$} .001 in all cases). For prostate, breast, colorectal, esophageal, and head/neck cancers, the survival benefit associated with marriage was larger than the published survival benefit of chemotherapy.

Conclusion
Even after adjusting for known confounders, unmarried patients are at significantly higher risk of presentation with metastatic cancer, undertreatment, and death resulting from their cancer. This study highlights the potentially significant impact that social support can have on cancer detection, treatment, and survival.},

Some sociologists' reservations about rational choice arise from a misunderstanding of the theory. The first part of this essay therefore introduces rational choice as a general theoretical perspective, or family of theories, which explains social outcomes by constructing models of individual action and social context. ``Thin'' models of individual action are mute about actors' motivations, while ``thick'' models specify them ex ante. Other sociologists' reservations, however, stem from doubts about the empirical adequacy of rational choice explanations. To this end, the bulk of the essay reviews a sample of recent studies that provide empirical support for particular rational choice explanations in a broad spectrum of substantive areas in sociology. Particular attention is paid to studies on the family, gender, and religion, for these subareas often are considered least amenable to understanding in terms of rational choice logic.},

Merging microlevel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth with aggregated Public Use Microdata from the 1980 U.S. Census, we examine the impact of marriage market characteristics and other contextual variables on the risk of marital dissolution, net of individual-level predictors. Proportional hazards models reveal that, among non-Hispanic Whites, the risk of dissolution is highest where either wives or husbands encounter an abundance of spousal alternatives. Increased labor force participation among unmarried women and high geographic mobility rates in the local area also increase marital instability. Our results suggest that many persons remain open to alternative relationships even while married, and that the supply of spousal alternatives in the local marriage market significantly increases the risk of marital dissolution.},

It is shown that, controlling for age, the married have lower mortality rates than the single, the widowed, or the divorced and that the differences between the married and unmarried statuses are much greater for men than for women. It is argued that these relationships can, at least in part, be attributed to the characteristics of the marital statuses in our society, for: (1) precisely the same pattern is found in studies of psychlogical wellbeing and mental illness; (2) the evidence from specific types of mortality indicates that this pattern is characteristic primarily of types of mortality in which one's psychological state may greatly affect one's life chances; (3) a role explanation can account for the way the pattern varies with changes in age; and (4) it appears that the alternative explanation, namely, that the relationship are due to selective process, does not account for most of the variation in rates.},

  abstract = {This review focuses on the pathway leading from the marital relationship to physical health. Evidence from 64 articles published in the past decade, particularly marital interaction studies, suggests that marital functioning is consequential for health; negative dimensions of marital functioning have indirect influences on health outcomes through depression and health habits, and direct influences on cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, neurosensory, and other physiological mechanisms. Moreover, individual difference variables such as trait hostility augment the impact of marital processes on biological systems. Emerging themes in the past decade include the importance of differentiating positive and negative dimensions of marital functioning, the explanatory power of behavioral data, and gender differences in the pathways from the marital relationship to physiological functioning. Contemporary models of gender that emphasize self-processes, traits, and roles furnish alternative perspectives on the differential costs and benefits of marriage for men's and women's health.},

  abstract = {Objective. To determine if marital status is associated with differences in rates of progression of functional disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. A community cohort of 282 persons with RA was followed prospectively for up to 9.5 years. The progression of functional disability over time was determined using the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, which was completed by study participants every 6 months. Results. At study entry, the Disability Index was 1.1 {$\pm$} 0.8 (mean {$\pm$} 1 SD) (possible range 0\textendash{}3) among the 188 married participants and 1.3 {$\pm$} 0.9 among the 94 unmarried participants. Over time, the rate of progression of functional disability was generally higher among unmarried participants. However, the extent of this difference varied somewhat over the disease course, with rates of progression higher among unmarried than among married participants during years 5\textendash{}7 and years 17\textendash{}29 of RA. Overall estimated rates of progression, adjusted for the effects of other sociodemographic factors, were 0.03 Disability Index units per year in unmarried participants and 0.01 Disability Index units per year in married participants (P {$<$} 0.0001). Conclusion. Marriage, possibly reflecting the influence of social support, is associated with a lower rate of progression of functional disability in persons with RA.},

This article outlines possible mechanisms through which support systems may influence the etiology of physical disease. I begin by reviewing research on the relations between social support and morbidity and between social support and mortality. I distinguish between various conceptualizations of social support used in the existing literature and provide alternative explanations of how each of these conceptualizations of the social environment could influence the etiology of physical disease. In each case, I address the psychological mediators (e.g., health relevant cognitions, affect, and health behaviors) as well as biologic links (e.g., neuroendocrine links to immune and cardiovascular function). I conclude by proposing conceptual and methodological guidelines for future research in this area, highlighting the unique contributions psychologists can make to this inherently interdisciplinary endeavor.},

If the same coping strategies used by individuals in response to stress are those that are applied to distressed persons as assistance, models of coping and support can be integrated. To illustrate the utility of such an integration, coping strategies and support strategies are derived from a more general theory of stress-buffering processes. A variety of supportive strategies not previously identified by researchers are derived, such as situational reinterpretations, deliberate distraction, drug therapy, and mutual role-playing. Predictions regarding efficacious and nonefficacious types of support are made, and empathic understanding (based on sociocultural and situational similarities between a distressed person and a helper) is identified as a crucial condition for coping assistance to be sought, accepted, and found effective.
